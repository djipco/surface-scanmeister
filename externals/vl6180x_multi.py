"""
vl6180x_multi module.

This module exposes a class allowing the creation and management of multiple VL6180x sensors on the
same I2C bus. By default, this is not possible since the devices all have the same address (0x29).
To circumvent that, the devices are assigned new addresses.

Thanks to Vitaly Grinberg for making the original code available under an MIT licence. For details:
